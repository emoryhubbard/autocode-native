ASK_FULL='Could you write a new ${step["target"]} with this modification: "${step["description"]}". In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) within its code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_SNIPPET='Could you write a code snippet for a new ${step["target"]} with this modification: "${step["description"]}". In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) (providing a second code snippet if needed) within its code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_FUNCTIONS='Could you write a code snippet for a new ${step["target"]} with this modification: "${step["description"]}". The code snippet should contain only the functions that will be modified or created. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) (providing a second code snippet if needed) within its code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_SHORT='Could you give me just a short code snippet (DON\'T include the whole file or unmodified functions) that modifies ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". The code snippet should contain only the functions that will be modified or created. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) (providing a second code snippet if needed) within its code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_TERSE='Could you give me just a short code snippet (your response should be terse, no explanations, just code, and DON\'T include the whole file or unmodified functions) that modifies ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". The code snippet should contain only the functions that will be modified or created. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) (providing a second code snippet if needed) within its code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_RETURN='Could you modify ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". Note that in this chat system your response is constrained to be a small size, so don\'t worry about including any explanations--you can just send the code. Also, don\'t worry about component return statements that occupy many code lines, just include a snippet of the portion that needs to be changed if necessary. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) somewhere within the code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_NO_RETURN='Could you modify ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". Note that in this chat system your response is constrained to be a small size, so don\'t worry about including any explanations--you can just send the code. Also, DON\'t include the component return statement in full, unless it is very very short. Just include the changed portion. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) somewhere within the code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_MODIFICATIONS='Could you provide snippets of modifications to ${step["target"]}, that implement this change: "${step["description"]}". Note that in this chat system your response is constrained to be a small size, so don\'t worry about including any explanations--you can just send the code. Also, DON\'t include the component return statement in full if it is longer than a few lines of code. Just include the changed portion. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) somewhere within the code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_ENTIRELY='Could you modify ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". Note that in this chat system your response is constrained to be a small size, so don\'t worry about including any explanations--you can just send the code. Also, DON\'t include the component return statement entirely! Just include the changed portion. In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) somewhere within the code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?'
ASK_EXAMPLE='Could you modify ${step["target"]} like this: "${step["description"]}". Note that in this chat system your response is constrained to be a small size, so don\'t worry about including any explanations--you can just send the code.

In addition, could you write a simple console log statement(s) somewhere within the code to verify the change is working, which is highly likely to run (not lost in a function that isn\'t called)?
